    <h2>My autobiography in a nutshell</h2>
    <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p class="FirstPar">My name is <span class="nameitalic">Kirill</span>. I was born in 1995 in Minsk, Belarus. I had been attending middle school №181 since 2002 till 2012.
    I used to be a multifaceted child. I attended many different sections, from drawing to table tennis. Also I loved playing video games.</p>
    <h3>University</h3>
    <p class="SecondPar">After school I started my studying in <span class="wordshadow">BSU, FAMCS</span>, and it was really hard for me at first, as I was not prepared for so many math lessons.
    Nevertheless, I had success and became quite good at math. I had been visiting the university for 5 years since 2012. I graduated from BSU in 2017.</p>
    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p calss="ThirdPar">From 5th year of my studying in BSU I started working in Bank Technologies Center. To be honest, I had no choice, but it was a kind of
    good opportunity to start <span class="wordbold">working</span>. We produce different systems and software for banks, but most of the time I have to
    eliminate issues and alter some stuff. Now I am bored of this kind of work and felt desperate to escape.</p>
